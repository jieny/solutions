Corresponding local language experience packs (LXPs);\n       2.

When each version is updated, please re-create the image. For example, when crossing from 21H1 to 22H2, please do not update on the basis of the old image, and other compatibility problems should be avoided; remind you again, please use the initial version to create.\n      b.
